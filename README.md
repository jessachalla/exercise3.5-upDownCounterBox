ANGULAR EXERCISE 3.5
Skills: Components, controllers, ngModel, ngClick, Directives
Use your component named upDownCounter from exercise 3, with the modification that you
will now go up and down by 10.
Create an expandOnFocus directive that increases the size when the element is focused. The size returns to normal on blur. Restrict the directive to attributes. Apply this directive to several form inputs.
Put the expandOnFocus directive into the upDownCounter, and pass the count into the directive as the height to set the focused input.
